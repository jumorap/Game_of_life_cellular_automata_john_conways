# What is?
- **Wikipedia definition:** The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

 **Rules:**
- Rule #1: A cell is "dead" if have 3 neighbors alive around.
- Rule #2: A cell is "alive" with less of 2 of more than 3 neighbors alive.

# How install?
> **1.** Open your console (press Windows + R, write *cmd*) and use:
- git clone https://github.com/jumorap/Game_of_life_cellular_automata_john_conways
> **2.**  Need install the libraries **numpy, times, pygame**, so, if do you need, can install **pip** in your PC. If you already installed **pip**, use next commands:
- pip install numpy
- pip install times
- pip install pygame
> **3.** If you already installed it, execute in your console: 
- cd Game_of_life_cellular_automata_john_conways
- python main.py (you can write *py main.py*)

And will appear a window with a prepared funny "game".
**TO CLOSE THE WINDOW** in your console press (Ctrl + C) 1 time, and several occasions if your system don't works (don't worry).

# How to use?
- To pause the game, you must press any key and to resume, you must do the same.
- To create automata, with your mouse give a left click in a cell.
- To delete automata, with your mouse give right click in a cell.
- Enjoy the game.

*Enjoy this game, you will love how works the automata.*
