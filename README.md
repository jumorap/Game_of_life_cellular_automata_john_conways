# What is?
**Wikipedia definition:** The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.<p/>

 **Rules:**
- Rule #1: A cell is "dead" if have 3 neighbors alive around.
- Rule #2: A cell is "alive" with less of 2 of more than 3 neighbors alive.

# How install?
**1.** Open your console and clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/jumorap/Game_of_life_cellular_automata_john_conways
```
**2.** Change the working directory to opera-extension-generator:
```
cd Game_of_life_cellular_automata_john_conways
```
**3.** Install the requirements (You need to have installed Python3):
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And will appear a window with a started funny "game".
**TO CLOSE THE WINDOW** in your console press (Ctrl + C) 1 time, and several times if don't works (don't worry).

# How to use?
- To pause the game, you must press any key and to resume, you must do the same.
- To create automata, with your mouse give a left click in a cell.
- To delete automata, with your mouse give right click in a cell.
- Enjoy the game.

*Enjoy this game, you will love how works the automata.*

# Possible troubles
If you are in Windows, using **python3** might not work. Use **python** instead.<br/>
If you canÂ´t finish the game, just close the console or press (Ctrl + C)
